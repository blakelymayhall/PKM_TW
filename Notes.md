- Tilemap tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyyJJL2g9Cg
- Is a great tutorial for how to build a 2D RPG, but doesn't answer my question on movement -- what if I want to move like in Pokemon where my movements snap to nearest tile's center?
	- This forum looks promising: https://forum.unity.com/threads/how-do-i-get-started-with-grid-based-movement.794673/

- Going to try to implement a simple tilemap for a character to navigate over
	- Colored tiles to represent things?
- Implemented this and fiddled with grid movement to see if I could get something close to Pokemon style movement
- Found something I like - going to upload to github and link here:

- Enabling VSync helped a lot 
- Going to review the 2D rogue like tutorial and see what I can learn from that movement style
- Ultimate goal is to eliminate the ice skating movement and maybe introduce additional 'snappiness' to the movement.

- Implement things learned from the rouge like tutorial - major overhaul of the movement but it is much better
- Need to reimplement the single-tap turns 
- Need to hone-in on speed I think
